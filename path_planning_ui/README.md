Goal: Design a UI to integrate the path planning workflow for the [Bathydrone](https://aprilab.mae.ufl.edu/research/), using [FastSAM](https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/FastSAM) for water body detection.

# Usage
Once finished setting up a virtual environment and installing the necessary packages, the UI can be opened with
```console
$ python april_fastsam_ui.py
```
After a few seconds, the UI should pop up as a separate window:
